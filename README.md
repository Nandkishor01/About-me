Provides a quick and easy way to create a website to showcase your name, country of origin and projects!

## :information_source:	 About

I built this project primarily to understand how to implement a small and simple website (microservices), and serverless deployment.

Also, I believe this is a cute way to show where you are from or where you built your project, so yeah.

Initial inspiration for the project came from [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/naveenjetty/pen/eBVdez).
